I can: connect to the mud connect the log page to the mud move from
room to room look at the room and at objects I can see exits now when
I look

I need to create a new event that finds the players room when they
login and then moves them to that room. When the player logs in I
have no idea what room they are in and I don’t want the connection
object asking the player object anything.

I’m getting back into this and I’m trying to play the mud. I’ve
got the server started (which starts the web server) and I’ve
attached the browser to it. - I changed the websocket to 8081 and
added it to sys.config - 8080 is being used by my budget application
- I don’t want to have to hard-code the port, however the web page
is still hard-coded

I added an export to the ./r script so that the erlmud_event_log will
log there instead of the current working directory, which for a
release is _rel/erlmud/

I’m using erlmud_world.erl to initialize the world but when I do
“look” I don’t seem to get any response. So, I’m working
through how to look at the room or a player. I did “look Bob”,
which is the player name in erlmud_test_worlds.hrl, but I get nothing.

What are the handlers listed in the event log? Ah, that’s just part
of the properties of the object calling into erlmud_event_log, so
it’s probably erlmud_conn because the handlers are:
erlmud_handler_conn_enter_world erlmud_handler_conn_send Where do
those get added? Ah, erlmud_conn adds them I think erlmud_conn
creates a new erlmud_object that is a proxy for the erlmud_conn
process and handles events It only responds to: {Owner, enter_world,
in, _Room, with, Self} … however, what erlmud_conn sends to the new
connection erlmud object is: Message = {PlayerPid, enter_world, with,
ConnObjPid}, So I’m missing in, _Room So, why are the tests
passing? Do we not count on entering the world? Nope, we don’t seem
to. Ah, we only need that to send messages to the player: When we do
send the connection erlmud object with the Player as the owner will
subscribe to the message and send the message on success Hmm, seems
like it’s useless, because even the test socket creates that object
but the event is not sent properly

Ugh, my brain is fuzzy.
So I’m working on getting erlmud playable. I can log in. I can look.
When I “look” I see “an empty room” when I _should_ see people in the room. (as the tests do)
Why don’t I see anything else?
